# Qtile Configurations

Welcome to my Qtile configuration repository. This repository houses my customized Qtile configurations, providing a simple and lightweight setup that is highly customizable.

## Features

* Automatic application startup and termination: Easily manage the applications that should start automatically with Qtile and gracefully terminate them when necessary.
* Seamless application management: Assign applications to specific virtual workstations, allowing for efficient multitasking and workspace organization.
